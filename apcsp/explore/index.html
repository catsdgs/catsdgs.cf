      <br>
      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>About Website</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">This very simple website includes everything that you would need to grade my project, including images and pdfs. If you would like to download the website, you can press CTRL + S on your keyboard, or you could go
      <a href="https://github.com/catsdgs/catsdgs.cf/blob/master/apcsp/explore">here</a> and save "index.html."
      Go <a href="">here</a> to see the written responses <b>not</b> in website format (that file is .pdf). If you are looking at this from a .html file, I encourage you to go <a href="https://catsdgs.cf/apcsp/explore/">here</a> to view the website online. <i>This website may be altered for the final submission.</i>

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2A</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">The innovation that I have chosen is a 3D Printer. A 3D printer is a
      printer that can print in 3 dimensions using filament. This filament is usually a type of plastic; PLA, ABS, and others. SLA, DLP, SLS, and EBM printers are the most common types of 3D printers. Here is a simple 
      image that I have created that illustrates
      how a 3D printer works (Figure 2A-1).

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2B</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class "my-4">I used Github to make a repository for my website (github.com). I mainly used Atom IDE (atom.io) to write the code, but I also had to use the online Github editor when I was at school (which I am using right now). 
      If you want to see the website's code, open the website file in an IDE (or any text editor), 
      or right click this page and click "View Page Source" or "View Source Code" (usually CTRL + U.)
      I used GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP [www.gimp.org]) to make all of the images.

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2C</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">One beneficial effect of 3D printing is that objects can be made easier. For example, there are 3D printers being made to make houses. There is an image of one of the pictures below (Figure 2C-1.) 
      A harmful effect is that people can get a little too involved in 3D printing, making people not creative or innovative. 
      People could start just using a common model to make everything.</h3>

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2D</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">Most 3D printers only require the printing file (usually in gcode). This is really all the data that the printer uses. The gcode is then used to position the motors for the print. This is done many times (usually repeated) to make the final print look smoother. 
      Some printers cure resin to print, making the print smoother, which uses the same code, but is processed differently. The print file also contains information on when to extrude the fillament. <br><br> If the file is sent over the internet, like some printers, some of the information might be lost. 
      if even one little detail in the code is lost, the whole print could be ruined. Although this is rare, it is a concern in some commercial cases where small details matter.</h3>
