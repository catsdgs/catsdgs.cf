      <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to the official website for my APCSP Explore Task! <i>By D.J. Saderholm</i></h1>

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>About Website</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">This website will include everything that you would neet to see my task, including images and pdfs. If you would like to download the website, you can press <input type="image" src="https://catsdgs.cf/keyimg1.png" id="keyimg" /> on your keyboard, or you could go
      <a href="https://github.com/catsdgs/catsdgs.cf/blob/master/apcsp/explore">here</a> and save all of the files (many files are online and do not need to be downloaded [like css.])
      Go <a href="">here</a> to see the written responses <b>not</b> in website format (that file is .pdf). If you are looking at this from a .html file, I encourage you to go <a href="https://catsdgs.cf/apcsp/explore/">here</a> to view the website online.

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2A</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">The innovation that I have chosen is a 3D Printer. A 3D printer is a
      printer that can print in 3 dimensions using filament. This filament is usually a type of plastic; PLA, ABS, and others. SLA, DLP, SLS, and EBM printers are the most common types of 3D printers. Here is a simple 
      image that I have created that illustrates
      how a 3D printer works (Figure 2A-1).
      </h3>
      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2B</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class "my-4">I used Github to make a repository for my website. To write the code, I mainly used Atom IDE, but I also had to use the online Github editor when I was at school. If you want to see the website's code, use a IDE or right click and click "View Page Source." I used GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to make all of the images above.</h3>
