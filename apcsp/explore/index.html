      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>About Website</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">This very simple website includes everything that you would need to grade my project, including images and pdfs. If you would like to download the website, you can press CTRL + S on your keyboard, or you could go
      <a href="https://github.com/catsdgs/catsdgs.cf/blob/master/apcsp/explore">here</a> and save "index.html."
      Go <a href="">here</a> to see the written responses <b>not</b> in website format (that file is .pdf). If you are looking at this from a .html file, I encourage you to go <a href="https://catsdgs.cf/apcsp/explore/">here</a> to view the website online.

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2A</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">The innovation that I have chosen is a 3D Printer. A 3D printer is a printer that can print in 3 dimensions using filament. This filament is usually a type of plastic: PLA, ABS, and others. SLA, DLP, SLS, and EBM printers are the most common types of 3D printers that you will find making small objects. Most 3D printers can print basically anything that you design using 3D design software on your computer, but some industrial machines are programmed to print specific objects. 3D printers are used for many different tasks, from printing small trinkets to printing machine casings. Here is a simple
      image that I have created that illustrates
      how a 3D printer works (Figure 2A-1).

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2B</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class "my-4">I used Github to make a repository for my website (github.com). I mainly used Atom IDE (atom.io) to write the code, but I also had to use the online Github editor when I was at school (which I am using right now).
      If you want to see the website's code, open the website file in an IDE (or any text editor),
      or right-click this page and click "View Page Source" or "View Source Code" (usually CTRL + U.)
      I used GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP [www.gimp.org]) to make all of the images.

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2C</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">One beneficial effect of 3D printing is that objects can be made easier. For example, 3D printers being made to make houses out of cement as seen in Figure 2C-1 With this technology, a normal size house could be built in 24 hours! These would be great for lower income neighborhoods, as 3D printed houses are cheaper to build. 3D printers like the ones used for houses could also be used to make other buildings like utility buildings or even jails. But if 3D printers became easily accessible people might loose their creativity and lack innovation. You might just rent one of these printers and print the same house that everyone else is printing because its easier than designing your own house in complicated software. Imagine all houses in one neighborhood, or even city, looking the same.</h3>

      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2D</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">Most 3D printers only require the printing file, usually compiled into one of the printing formats by the slicing software (the software that slices the model into printable layers). One of the more common formats is STL (Standard Tessellation Language). Some of the other formats include OBJ (Object), AMF (Advanced Module File), and 3ML. The code is then used to position the motors for the print. This is done many times (usually repeated) to make the final print look smoother. Some printers cure resin to print, making the print smoother, which uses the same code, but is processed differently. The print file also contains information on when to extrude the filament. If the file is sent over the Internet, like some printers, some of the information might be lost. if even one little detail in the code is lost, the whole print could be ruined. Although this is rare, it is a concern in some commercial cases where small details matter. 3D printers usually have one motor for each axis: X, Y, and Z. These motors spin back and forth to position the head. The head has an extruder which heats up the end of a spool of filament to the perfect temperature where the filament dries soon after it is extruded. This temperature varies depending on the type of filament. A motor and wheel extrude the filament on to the platform. Some 3D printers have a heated platform to help assist the object removal process.
