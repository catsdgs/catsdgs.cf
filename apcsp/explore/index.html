      <h2 class="my-4"><b><i>Response 2A</i></b></h2>
      <h3 class="my-4">The innovation that I have chosen is a 3D Printer. A 3D printer is a
      printer that can print in 3 dimensions using filament. This filament is usually a type of plastic; PLA, ABS, and others. SLA, DLP, SLS, and EBM printers are the most common types of 3D printers. Here is an image that I have created that illustrates
      how a 3D printer works (Figure 2A-1).
